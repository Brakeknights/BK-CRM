# Brakeknights Project

## Session Startup Checklist (Run These First, Every Session)
1. `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` — activates the master push block
2. `git branch --show-current` — confirm you are on `claude/gallant-ptolemy-9gZLb` (or the current feature branch); if not, switch: `git checkout claude/gallant-ptolemy-9gZLb`

## Master Push Override
The pre-push hook blocks all pushes to master by default.
To override: user says **"go master"** in chat. Claude then runs the push with `MASTER_OVERRIDE="go master"` set as an env var.

## Skill/Tooling Push Override
For changes that are dev tooling only (skills, hooks, scripts — nothing that affects the live site):
User says **"go skill"** in chat. Claude merges the feature branch to BOTH `dev` and `master` in one operation, using `MASTER_OVERRIDE="go skill"`.
No dev preview needed for tooling-only changes.

## Overview
Website and customer portal for Brakeknights (brakeknights.com).
Built with Node.js/Express, deployed on Hostinger.

## Key Facts
- **brakeknights.com is now the code-based Node.js/Express site** — deployed from the `master` branch via Hostinger git auto-deploy
- The old Hostinger website builder site was replaced during launch
- Live site must never be broken — always preview on dev first

## Branch & Deployment Workflow
- `dev` branch → **auto-deploys to dev.brakeknights.com** via Hostinger git integration (Branch: dev, Node 22) — just push to `dev` and it deploys automatically
- `master` branch → deploys to **brakeknights.com** (live site)
- All changes go on feature branch first. Only merge to `dev` when user approves. Only merge to `master` when user approves.
- Never push directly to `master` without explicit user approval.
- **Deployment note:** Both `dev` and `master` branches are configured for Hostinger git auto-deploy. Pushing triggers automatic deployment. SMTP_PASS env var is set in Hostinger for both dev.brakeknights.com and brakeknights.com.

## Hostinger MCP
A Hostinger MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json`.
It allows direct management of Hostinger hosting from Claude Code.
The API token is entered securely at session start — never hardcode it.

## Project Structure
- `server.js` — Express server, reads PORT from environment
- `public/index.html` — frontend HTML
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — Node.js dependencies

## Writing & Punctuation Rules
- No em dashes (—) unless grammatically required (e.g., true parenthetical aside). Use a colon for introducing lists/explanations, a comma for brief pauses, or rewrite the sentence. This applies to all copy: HTML, emails, CLAUDE.md, everywhere.

## Screenshots with Playwright
- Always use `element.offsetTop` to scroll to a section — never `getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY` (that value changes as the page scrolls and will land on the wrong section)
- Always use `offsetTop` pattern: `const y = await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector('#section-id').offsetTop); await page.evaluate((y) => window.scrollTo(0, y), y);`
- Never merge to `dev` without explicit user approval — commit and push to the feature branch only

## Dev Workflow Rules — ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE
⛔ STOP. READ THIS BEFORE EVERY PUSH. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER.

1. ALL changes go to the feature branch ONLY
2. After making changes: take a screenshot, show the user, then STOP and WAIT
3. Do NOT merge to `dev` until the user explicitly says "push to dev" or "merge to dev" or "approved for dev"
4. Do NOT merge to `master` under any circumstances without explicit user approval
5. "I won't do it again" is not enough — CHECK THIS LIST before every single merge
6. ⛔ NEVER auto-merge to dev after a fix, even if it seems small or obvious

THE WORKFLOW IS:
  feature branch → show screenshot → WAIT FOR APPROVAL → then merge to dev
  dev → WAIT FOR APPROVAL → then merge to master

There is NO shortcut. There is NO exception. Not even "just a small fix."
ASKING "should I push to dev?" IS NOT ENOUGH — wait for the user to say it.
- Current feature branch: `claude/dazzling-planck-U9GXQ`

## Square Integration — Platform Build Plan

The long-term vision is a fully owned Brake Knights business platform. Square is used only as the payment processor and appointment calendar backend. All customer communication (quotes, confirmations, receipts, follow-ups) flows through our own system. Eventually white-labeled and sold to other service businesses.

### Architecture Decision
- Admin tools live at `brakeknights.com/admin` (password-protected, same server as public site)
- Square handles: payment processing, appointment calendar, sales reporting
- Our system handles: all customer-facing emails, CRM, quotes, job summaries, follow-up automation

### Square Env Vars (set in Hostinger hPanel for brakeknights.com)
- `SQUARE_APP_ID` — production app ID
- `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` — production access token
- `SQUARE_SANDBOX_APP_ID` — sandbox app ID
- `SQUARE_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` — sandbox access token
- Connection verified: `brakeknights.com/api/square/verify` returns `{"environment":"production","customers":"ok","bookings":"ok"}`

### Square Module
- `square.js` — initializes SquareClient from env vars, exports `client` and `verifyConnection()`
- Defaults to production when `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is present and `SQUARE_ENV` is not `sandbox`

### Platform Build Phases

**Phase 2 (current — in progress):** When a customer submits the contact form, automatically create or find them as a Square customer. Foundation of the CRM.

**Phase 3:** Quote tool — owner enters service + price + proposed time, system sends a branded quote email to the customer.

**Phase 4:** Booking confirmation — once price/time agreed, owner books in Square, our system sends a full branded confirmation email: service, price, date, time, address.

**Phase 5:** Job summary + custom receipt — after payment, owner triggers a branded receipt with a proper Technician Notes section (Square's native receipt has no custom notes section).

**Phase 6:** Follow-up automation — notes entered on the job summary trigger timed reminder emails to owner and customer (e.g. "rear brakes have 6 months left" → reminder email sent at that time).

**Phase 7:** Full CRM dashboard at `brakeknights.com/admin` — customer profiles, vehicle history, job history, upcoming follow-ups, all owned by Brake Knights.

**Phase 8:** Automated quotes — instant quote emails based on vehicle type and service selected (requires pricing table to be finalized first).

**Phase 9:** White-label packaging — multi-tenant architecture, per-brand configuration, reseller infrastructure for other service businesses.

### Current Customer Flow (for context)
- Customer calls/texts → verbal price + schedule discussion → owner books in Square → Square sends confirmation (date/time only, no price)
- Customer submits form → owner replies by email with price → customer confirms → owner books in Square → Square sends confirmation (date/time only, no price)
- Payment: credit card via Square POS app on phone; cash/Zelle recorded manually in Square for sales tracking

## Current Work in Progress
Update this section at the end of each session to stay caught up next time.

- `dev` branch → dev.brakeknights.com (auto-deploy on push) ✅
- `master` branch → brakeknights.com (live site, auto-deploy on push) ✅ — **site is live**
- Form emails fully working on both dev and live: internal notification + customer confirmation ✅
- Pre-push hook in place — direct pushes to `master` blocked; override with "go master" keyword ✅
- "go skill" keyword added — pushes tooling-only changes to both dev and master in one shot ✅
- Session startup hook shows pending dev-vs-master commits at session start ✅
- Screenshot skill in place — `node scripts/screenshot.js [path] [selector]` ✅
- Playwright Chromium installed by session hook — no mid-task download delays ✅
- Google Search Console verified (DNS TXT record) and sitemap submitted ✅
